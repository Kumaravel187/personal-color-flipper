# Exchange Rate App Calculator Project

This is a simple web application that allows the user to view three different color pickers. The three different color pickers are simple, hex and gradient mode.

- Simple consists of a fixed array of values
- Hex consists of hexadecimal color values
- Gradient consists of gradient hexadecimal color values

Note: While the colors generated are in hexa code, the CSS properties displayed are in RGB values as they are automatically being converted in the CSS properties. 

## Features

- Three different color pickers.
